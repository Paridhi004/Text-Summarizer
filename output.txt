Summary:
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any
device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its 
chance of achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence"
is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions such as
"learning" and "problem solving". As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require 
"intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon 
known as the AI effect.
